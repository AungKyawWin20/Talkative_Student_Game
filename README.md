## About
This simulation demonstrates how disruptive behavior can spread in a classroom setting. The "infection" metaphor represents how one talkative student can influence others, while the teacher tries to maintain order.

## How It Works
- 🟢 Green dot students represent well-behaved students
- 🗣 One talkative student who influences others
- 👩🏫 Teacher who issues warnings
- ⚠️ After multiple warnings, the talkative student gets removed
- 🔄 Students move randomly within classroom boundaries
- 🦠 When kicked out, the talkative student "infects" others

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AungKyawWin20/Talkative_Student_Game.git
```
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy
```

## Usage
Simulate with default parameters with Jupyter Notebook

## Future Enhancements
- Add visualization using matplotlib
- Implement distance-based infection mechanics
- Add GUI interface
- Include different student personalities
- Add classroom seating arrangements
